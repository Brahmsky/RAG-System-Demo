Photosynthesis is the process in which plants, algae, and certain bacteria use light energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into energetic organic compounds and release oxygen. This process is crucial for maintaining the carbon oxygen balance of the Earth. Photosynthesis mainly occurs in chloroplasts, and its reactions can be divided into two stages: light reaction and dark reaction. The light reaction stage occurs on the thylakoid membrane of chloroplasts, requiring the participation of light and water. The products are ATP, NADPH, and oxygen. Oxygen is released into the atmosphere as a byproduct. The dark reaction stage, also known as the Calvin cycle, occurs in the matrix of chloroplasts. It utilizes ATP and NADPH produced by light reactions to fix and reduce carbon dioxide, ultimately synthesizing organic compounds such as sugars. There are many factors that affect photosynthesis, including light intensity, carbon dioxide concentration, temperature, and moisture.
